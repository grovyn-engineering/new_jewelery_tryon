"""
Photo pre-check gate for the hair try-on flow.

Runs BEFORE the photo is sent to the Nano Banana / Gemini image-edit call,
so customers get an immediate, specific rejection reason instead of a
silently bad AI-generated result.

Checks implemented (see conversation history for the full rationale of
each): face count, face size/framing, head pose, blur, brightness,
detection confidence, and a lightweight occlusion heuristic. Content
moderation is NOT implemented here -- that should stay a hosted API
(AWS Rekognition / Google SafeSearch / Azure Content Safety) rather than
something built in an afternoon.

Usage:
    python validate_photo.py <photo.jpg>

As a library:
    from validate_photo import validate_photo
    result = validate_photo("photo.jpg")
    if not result["passed"]:
        # result["failures"] is a list of {code, message} the frontend can show directly
        ...
